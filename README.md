# cam
CAM (C Advanced Mathematics) is a library written in C with multiple components. Linear algebra (designed with OpenGL in mind), complex & quaternion algebra, numerical integration, fourier analysis, and whatever other computational tidbits I find interesting. Designed to be cross-platform and reasonably well optimized.
